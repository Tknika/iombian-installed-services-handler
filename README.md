# IoMBian Installed Services Handler

This services takes care of starting and stopping the compose of the services whenever a services is added or removed to the "iombian-services" folder.
It also restarts the services when a change occurs in them.

This handler allows manual creation of services in the "iombian-services" folder, but the use of "IoMBian Installed Services Downloader" is recommended.
